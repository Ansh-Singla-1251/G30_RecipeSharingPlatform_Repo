                <li><b>Feedback:</b> After testing, our team provides feedback to the recipe author. If any adjustments are needed, we work with the author to refine the recipe.</li>
                <li><b>Approval:</b> Once a recipe passes our testing process, it is marked as "Kitchen Approved" and highlighted on our platform. This designation lets users know that the recipe has been thoroughly vetted and is guaranteed to deliver delicious results.</li>
                <li><b>Community Input:</b> We also value the input of our community. Users can rate and review "Kitchen Approved Recipes," sharing their own experiences and tips for success.</li>
